Deployed Application: https://shelbypalumbo.github.io/Memory-Game/

## User Story

As a lifelong learner, I want the ability to test my memory, so that I can improve my short term memory skills.

## Usage

Users of the Memory Game will be prompted to choose a board size upon selecting " New Game". The board size determines the amount of cards a user will play with and generate duplicate numbers from the value of the boards size divided by 2, then the cards are shuffled and displayed.

If a match is found, the card will lay face up and add 10 pts to the starting score of 100. If two cards are flipped that are not a match, the cards will return to hidden after a few seconds and remove 1pt from the score.
